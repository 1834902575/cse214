02.Define a function to print single node (address,value,and next address)of the linked list and do the same as problem 1.


03.Define a function to display(only value for each node)the complete linked list and do the same as problem 1.


04.Use Dynamic Memory Allocation to create three elements of the linked list and display(only value)the complete linked list using a function.


05.Define a function to display the compelete linked list with a recursive function using problem-04.


06.Define a function to display the compelete linked list in reverse order with a recursive function using problem-04.
